# Braxton M | UCBC18_SocialNetworkAPI_NoSQL | README
 
This project incorporates the use of `Node.js`, `Express.js`, and `MongoDB` to mimick a social media application
that allows users to be created, post their thoughts, add friends, and react to the thoughts that are posted.
The social network API is tested by creating different routes for the endpoints to test on `Insomina` by using 
the id given to a user and their thought to use simple `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `GET` endpoints.
 
The bulk of this project was to learn `MongoDB` and get use to changing how we used our connections to a database, models, and schemas
that would create the database. Once a framework was laid out it became connecting the dots in evaluating the endpoints.
 
 
## Acceptance Criteria
 
```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list
```
 
## Installation
 
- Clone the repository
- Run `npm i` in your terminal to install the dependencies
- Download `MongoDB` and `MongoDB Compass`
- Once you have connected your project to `MongoDB` run `node server.js` to start the server
- Install `Insomnia` to test endpoints
    

## Usage
 
Use this project to learn more about the interaction of NoSQL, learning how to implement MongoDB, and the interaction of endpoints.
